Approach 1 Round Robin

Advantages 
1. All the request are distributed equally between the servers

Disadvantage

1. Server 2 is down --> 
Every  request to that particular server will fail 

To solve this --> Health Check 

Approach 2: Round Robin with health check info stored in the load balancer

Only send request to alive servers 

Disadvantage
1. Server is taking some time to complete the request

To solve --> Add response time in the load balancer

------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: All of there works for stateless services.

Diffrence between Stateless and Statefull Services. 

STATELESS -> The response to a request will be the same irrespective of the machine you send the request to. 

STATEFULL -> The response to a request will be diffrent when you send the same request to a diffrent machine
